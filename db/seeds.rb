# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

  description: %&* Create an application to track homework assignments.
* This application should have users, assignments, and completed assignments (turn-ins? This needs a decent name.)
* An assignment has a title, description, assigned date, and due date. All of the above are required. The description is in Markdown and should render correctly.
* Each user can complete each assignment, making a record of that completion.
* Users have to be able to log in. You can make a simple login or use another gem if you think thats a good idea.
* Each person has a page that shows their assignments and whether or not theyve completed each one.
* Past due assignments are visually highlighted.
* Assignments are not shown before their assigned date on each users page.
* Completed assignments should have a text box to paste in their work or a URL that points to their work.
* Bonus: Completed assignments can have comments on them.
* Bonus: Use a before_action method to prevent people from seeing homework before its assigned date.
* Bonus: Make teacher and student accounts. Teachers do not have to do homework; students cannot create homework. Teachers can see a list of all homework assigned and each persons completions.&,
