# Home Central

This is a tracker for homeworks basically made to be use for code homeworks. The system has users that can be Teachers or Students.

- Teachers can create, edit and delete homeworks (assignments), and can review and approve students' submitted code.
- Students have a view of all homework to date, with labels to identify actives, incompletes and completed one. They are not allowed to edit or change anything in the homework itself, and they can submit code to their teacher.
